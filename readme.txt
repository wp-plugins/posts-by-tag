Provide sidebar widgets that can be used to display posts from a set of tags in the sidebar.

== Description ==

Posts By Tag WordPress Plugin, provides sidebar widgets which can be used to display posts from a specific set of tags in the sidebar. You can also use shortcode or template function to display the posts.

The Plugin caches the posts of each widget separately, and issues database queries only when needed. This will reduce the amount of database queries involved for each page load and will therefore be light on your server.

### Features

#### Sidebar Widget

Posts By Tag Plugin provides a sidebar widget which can be configured to display posts from a set of tags in the sidebar. You can have multiple widgets with different set of tags configured for each one of them.

Each widget allows you to choose

*   The set of tags whose posts should be displayed 
*   The number of posts to be displayed. 
*   Option to enable post excerpts to be displayed with post titles. 
*   Option to display post thumbnail if present.
*   Choose the order in which the posts should be displayed.

#### Template function

In addition to using the widget, you can also use the following template function to display posts from a set of tags, anywhere in the theme

posts_by_tag($tags, $num, $excerpt = false, $thumbnail = false, $order_by = "date", $order = "desc", author = false);

*   $tags (string) - set of comma seperated tags
*   $num (number) - number of posts to display
*   $excerpt (bool) - To display post excerpts or not
*   $thumbnail (bool) - To display post thumbnails or not
*   $order_by (date,title) - Whether to order by date or by title.
*   $order (asc,desc) - To change the order in which the posts are displayed.
*   $author (bool) - To display author name or not.

#### Shortcode

You can also include the shortcode, to display the posts from the set of tags

[posts-by-tag tags = "tag1, tag2"][/posts-by-tag]

All the parameters that are accepted by the template tag can also be used in the shortcode

### Translation

*   Swedish (Thanks Gunnar Lindberg Årneby)
*   Turkish (Thanks Yakup Gövler)
*   Belorussian (Thanks [FatCow][2])

The pot file is available with the Plugin. If you are willing to do translation for the Plugin, use the pot file to create the .po files for your language and let me know. I will add it to the Plugin after giving credit to you.

### Support
